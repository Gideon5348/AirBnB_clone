AirBnB Clone - The Console

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) implementation of an AirBnB clone. The console allows users to interact with a simulated property rental service, similar to AirBnB, through a series of commands. Users can create, update, delete, and search for property listings, as well as manage user accounts and other related operations.

Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a text-based interface that enables users to interact with the AirBnB clone's functionality. It accepts a variety of commands and arguments to perform actions within the system. The core commands include managing property listings, users, reviews, amenities, and more. It is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient way to simulate the operation of an AirBnB-like service.

How to Start the Console
To start the AirBnB clone console, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Gideon5348/AirBnB_clone.git

Change to the project directory: cd AirBnB-clone

Run the console: ./AirBnB_clone.py

Now, you should be in the command interpreter environment and ready to start using the AirBnB clone console.
